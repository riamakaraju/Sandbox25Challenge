Challenges + What I Learned --------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think the biggest challenge I faced was that I decided to implement this in Java even though I only have basic AP CSA knowledge since I only took fundies 1 and am currently taking Fundies 2 this summer. Therefore, I had a vague idea of how to structure my classes, but I found that I had to play around with methods, especially in my Main.java file as some of the methods had to be placed outside the public static void main method for it to function.

Furthermore, I struggled understanding how Postman worked since I've never worked with JSON, but after some reading and experimenting, I figured it out pretty quickly! I learned that {} in JSON indicates the usage of a map and [] indicates Lists, so I structured my data as such.
